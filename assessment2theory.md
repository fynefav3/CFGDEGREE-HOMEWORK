IHUOMA FAVOUR AGBARU ASSESSMENT 

1.The hashing based program has the time complexity of O(n) which is Constant time  and requires O(n) extra space, where n is the size of the input.

2.The time complexity of the depth first search algorithm is the worst case scenario as one would have to traverse all through the nodes to get the desired tree. The Time complexity is calculated as 0(n) 0(edges + vertex). The space complexity is 0(n).

3.The palindrome pointer program has a time complexity of 0(n) and a space complexity of 0(1) This is because it doesn’t have to create a new string, all the program has to do is use some simple pointers working with the same size of an input and ultimately return true or false which takes less time.

4.The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), since it is an iterative method the space complexity is 0(1).

Part 4
You have been tasked with creating a music application. When I (as a user) go onto this 
application, I should be able to select a desired song and listen to it. 
You will not need to code anything, only design the application. As this is a vague and fairly 
open-ended question, consider the following points to include in your ‘design’ answer: 
● Consider - who is the user? 
Answer: a A user is a lover of music and sounds. Who sees music as a means of expressing emotions.

Do they have a persona?
ANSWER:   yes they have persona
 Who are you catering for? 
ANSWER:  
A music lover
A fitness lover.
An afro pop lover.
Someone who enjoys art and theatre perfomance.

● Design the application - what platform (web, mobile)? What may it look like (simple 
sketch is fine, or word-description)? What colours would you use and why? Think of 
this design like the way you approached the ‘Design the perfect door’ task for your 
Theory Assignment● What design heuristics and principles will you be following? How does your design 
meet or fail to meet them?

Clarity: Understanding how I wanted my design to be was the first component I put into consideration. How should my door look and for who should it be designed for.
Time: Timely delivery of how my design should look like was put into consideration.
Color: I wanted my colors to suite my persona, who is a male that loves move and style.
Balance: The rectangles and lines used in the design should be balance and not contrast each other.
Unity: The manner in which different forms in a design piece relate to each other is important.
Space: The space between the the shapes, Depth, perspective, overlapping, illusion.

Design Heuristics
Design heuristics is a usability inspection method for computer software that helps to identify usability problems in the user interface design.
My design/music application followed the following design heuristics pattern:
Flexible and efficient to use: A disabled/first time user, should not have issues using the door. It has the option for push for the disabled and someone without issues can also choose to either use the push or pull option.
Aesthetics: my design/music is aesthetically pleasing to behold as it’s a with a strong personality.
Consistency and standards: The user does not have to wonder if the push/pull sign means different things as it solves the need of the user.

 What made you choose this design? 

Why did I choose this design?
I considered an adult male who loves music, to be reflective of the day’s hustle and bubble of life to understand that a calming relief of music is handy for him.

● What are some future considerations you may need to make for your design? You 
can google for this question areas like “Future trends of UX / UI” (only this area - please.

New 3d design models
Clean user interfaces (with a twist) Keeping user interfaces clean is a standard every UX designer should aim for.
The continued rise of Type Design.
